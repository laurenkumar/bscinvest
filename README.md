Your crypto Corner

A simple webpage where the user just have to paste its wallet adress to see a list of all the tokens he have and upon selection see the stats of each of them, their last news and their possible price if they reached the market cap of the top 10 cryptos.
As of now only the bsc network is supported.
Looking into adding others but have to think of the UI.

No data is stored on any database, the only storage used is LocalStorage so that the user does not have to retype its wallet address.
Will add a connect button to directly connect to metamask or others.

Its possible you have the reload the webpage to see the updated list
